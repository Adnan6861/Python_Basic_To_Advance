    "To understand functions, let's consider an analogy. Imagine that a chef works in a restaurant, and he gets repeated orders of recipes. The chef has two options:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1: He takes a recipe book, and every time he gets an order, he writes down the steps of that order and starts making the recipe.\n",
    "### Option 2: He writes down the recipe once and hangs it at one place. Whenever he gets an order for the same recipe, he simply follows the steps and makes the recipe."

    "# Benefits of Functions\n",
    "Using functions in programming offers several benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Code Reusability:\n",
    " You do not need to rewrite the same code over and over again. Functions allow you to reuse the code, making your program more efficient.\n",
    "# Concise, Clean, and Modular Code:\n",
    " If you have multiple tasks to perform, you can create a function for each task. This makes the code more organized and easier to understand. For example, instead of writing 10 lines of code for 10 tasks, you can create functions for each and use them multiple times.\n",
    "# Error Reduction:\n",
    " When performing repetitive tasks, the chances of making mistakes increase. By using functions, you reduce the possibility of errors as you are calling the same code instead of re-writing it every time."

    "Input: A fruit.\n",
    "Output: Juice made from that fruit.\n",
